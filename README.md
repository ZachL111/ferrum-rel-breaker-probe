# ferrum-rel-breaker-probe

`ferrum-rel-breaker-probe` explores reliability with a small Solidity codebase and local fixtures. The technical goal is to develop a Solidity command-oriented project for breaker scenarios with node-edge fixtures, cycle and reachability reports, and no network dependency.

## Purpose

The project exists to keep a narrow engineering decision visible and testable. For this repo, that decision is how budget pressure and recovery gap should influence a review result.

## Ferrum Rel Breaker Probe Review Notes

The first comparison I would make is `runbook drift` against `budget pressure` because it shows where the rule is most opinionated.

## What Is Covered

- `fixtures/domain_review.csv` adds cases for budget pressure and failure width.
- `metadata/domain-review.json` records the same cases in structured form.
- `config/review-profile.json` captures the read order and the two review questions.
- `examples/ferrum-rel-breaker-walkthrough.md` walks through the case spread.
- The Solidity code includes a review path for `runbook drift` and `budget pressure`.
- `docs/field-notes.md` explains the strongest and weakest cases.

## Implementation Notes

The core code exposes a scoring path and the added review layer uses `signal`, `slack`, `drag`, and `confidence`. The domain terms are `budget pressure`, `failure width`, `recovery gap`, and `runbook drift`.

The Solidity checks add a pure review lens and Foundry coverage.

## Command

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

## Audit Path

The check exercises the source code and the review fixture. `recovery` is the high score at 212; `baseline` is the low score at 129.

## Limits

The fixture set is small enough to audit by hand. The next useful expansion is malformed input coverage, not extra surface area.
